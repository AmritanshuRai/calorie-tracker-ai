# Railway Deployment Configuration
# This file helps Railway properly detect and build your Node.js backend

# Railway will automatically:
# 1. Detect Node.js from package.json
# 2. Install dependencies with npm
# 3. Run Prisma generation
# 4. Start the server

# Make sure in Railway Settings:
# - Root Directory: server
# - Custom Build Command: (leave empty - nixpacks.toml handles it)
# - Custom Start Command: (leave empty - nixpacks.toml handles it)
# - Watch Paths: server/**
