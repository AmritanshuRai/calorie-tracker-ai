## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Initial Subscription

```
1. User clicks "Get Started Now"
2. Backend creates Razorpay Plan (if doesn't exist)
3. Backend creates Razorpay Subscription
4. Razorpay Checkout opens (shows recurring info)
5. User completes first payment
6. Subscription activated in database
7. User gets Pro access
```

### Auto-Renewal (Every Month/Year)

```
1. Razorpay automatically charges user
2. Webhook: subscription.charged event fires
3. Backend receives webhook
4. Updates subscription dates
5. Creates payment record
6. User's access continues seamlessly
```

### Cancellation

```
1. User requests cancellation
2. Backend calls Razorpay cancel API
3. Subscription status = "cancelled"
4. User retains access until period end
5. No further charges
```
