# Dodo Payments Integration - Phase 1 Complete ✅

## Overview

Successfully integrated Dodo Payments into the upgrade page with dynamic product fetching and checkout session creation.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend API Routes (`server/src/routes/payment.js`)

Created two endpoints:

#### GET `/api/payment/products`

- Fetches products from Dodo Payments API
- Filters for recurring products only (type: 'recurring')
- Returns monthly (30D) and annual (365D) plans
- **No authentication required** (public endpoint for pricing display)

#### POST `/api/payment/create-checkout-session`

- Creates a checkout session in Dodo Payments
- **Requires authentication** (user must be logged in)
- Accepts product ID, billing address, and customer info
- Returns checkout URL to redirect user to Dodo's hosted checkout page

### 2. Frontend Service (`client/src/services/paymentService.js`)

Created helper service with:

- `getProducts()` - Fetch products from backend
- `createCheckoutSession()` - Create checkout session
- Helper functions for price formatting and calculations

### 3. Updated Upgrade Page (`client/src/pages/Upgrade.jsx`)

Completely refactored to use Dodo Payments:

- **Dynamic pricing** from API (no hardcoded prices)
- Loading states while fetching products
- Automatic savings calculation for annual plans
- Disabled state handling for missing products
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Redirects to Dodo Payments checkout page on purchase

## Current Products from Dodo Payments

- **Metadata**: `{ type: "recurring", plan: "365D" }`

## User Flow

1. User visits `/upgrade` page
2. Page fetches products from backend API
3. User toggles between monthly/annual plans
4. User clicks "Get Started Now"
5. Frontend calls `/api/payment/create-checkout-session`
6. Backend creates session with Dodo Payments
7. User redirected to Dodo's hosted checkout page
8. User completes payment on Dodo's secure platform
9. User redirected back to `/dashboard` (configured in `return_url`)
