# 🚪 Logout Feature Implementation

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Account Page** (`/client/src/pages/Account.jsx`)

A comprehensive account/profile page with:

- ✨ User profile display (name, email, avatar)
- 📊 Profile statistics (gender, age, current weight, target weight)
- 🎯 Nutrition targets (BMR, TDEE, daily calories)
- 💪 Daily macros breakdown (protein, carbs, fats)
- 🚪 **Logout button** - Signs user out and redirects to login page
- 📱 Fully responsive (mobile + desktop)

### 2. **Navigation Integration**

Updated both Dashboard and Account pages:

- Desktop sidebar navigation is now fully clickable
- Mobile bottom navigation links to all pages
- Active state highlighting on current page
- Smooth navigation transitions

### 3. **Route Configuration**

Added protected route in `App.jsx`:

```jsx
<Route
  path='/account'
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <Account />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>
```

## 🎨 Account Page Features

### Profile Section

- **Avatar Circle**: Gradient green circle with user's first initial
- **User Info**: Name and email display
- **Goal Badge**: Current fitness goal (Lose Weight/Gain Weight/Improve Health)

### Profile Information Cards (Grid Layout)

1. **Gender** - Male/Female with 👤 icon
2. **Age** - User's age with 🎂 icon
3. **Current Weight** - In kg with ⚖️ icon
4. **Target Weight** - Goal weight with 🎯 icon

### Nutrition Targets Card

Displays calculated values:

- **BMR** (Basal Metabolic Rate) - 🔥
- **TDEE** (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) - ⚡
- **Daily Target** (Calorie Goal) - 🎯

### Daily Macros (3-Column Grid)

- **Protein** - Blue color
- **Carbs** - Green color
- **Fats** - Orange color

### Logout Button

- Red accent color (border-red-600, text-red-600)
- Logout icon (arrow right from door)
- Full width button
- Hover state: light red background
- **Action**: Clears all user data and redirects to "/"

## 🔐 Logout Functionality

### How It Works

1. **User clicks "Sign Out" button**
2. **Zustand store `logout()` function is called**:
   ```javascript
   logout: () =>
     set({
       user: null,
       token: null,
       isAuthenticated: false,
       onboardingData: {
         /* reset all */
       },
       bmr: null,
       tdee: null,
       dailyCalorieTarget: null,
       macros: { protein: null, carbs: null, fats: null },
     });
   ```
3. **All user data is cleared** from state and localStorage
4. **User is redirected** to `/` (login page)
5. **ProtectedRoute** prevents access to protected pages

### Security

- JWT token is removed from storage
- All sensitive data is cleared
- User cannot access protected routes after logout
- Clean state for next login

## 🎯 Navigation Structure

### Desktop (Sidebar - 80-96px width)

```
🥗 (Logo)
────────
🤵 Dietitian
🥗 Diet
📊 Tracker (Dashboard)
✍️ Logging
👤 Account ← New!
```

### Mobile (Bottom Navigation - 80px height)

```
🤵      🥗      📊      ✍️      👤
Dietitian Diet Tracker Logging Account
                                  ↑
                               New!
```

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Mobile (< 1024px)

- Full-width content
- Bottom navigation visible
- Sidebar hidden
- Compact card layout (2 columns for profile stats)

### Desktop (≥ 1024px)

- Fixed sidebar navigation
- Max-width 1024px content container

- Spacious card layout (2 columns for profile stats)

## 🎨 Design Consistency

The Account page follows the same design system:

- **Colors**: Green primary (#22c55e), neutral grays
- **Border Radius**: 2xl (16px) for cards
- **Shadows**: Soft shadows with hover elevation
- **Typography**: Same font hierarchy as Dashboard
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4-6-8-10 spacing scale

## 🔄 User Flow
