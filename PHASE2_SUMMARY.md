# Dodo Payments Phase 2 - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Completed

### 1. Database Schema Updates

- ✅ Updated `Subscription` model with Dodo-specific fields
- ✅ Updated `Payment` model with comprehensive payment details
- ✅ Created new `WebhookEvent` model for tracking all webhooks
- ✅ Ran `npx prisma db push` successfully
- ✅ Generated Prisma Client

### 2. Webhook Infrastructure

- ✅ Installed `standardwebhooks` package for signature verification
- ✅ Created `/api/webhook/dodo-payments` endpoint
- ✅ Implemented webhook signature verification using Dodo's webhook secret
- ✅ Set up raw body parsing for webhook endpoint (required for signatures)
- ✅ Created webhook event tracking system

### 3. Event Handlers Implemented

#### Payment Events

- ✅ `payment.succeeded` - Creates payment record, grants one-time access
- ✅ `payment.failed` - Records failed payments
- ✅ `payment.processing` - Tracks processing status
- ✅ `payment.cancelled` - Records cancellations

#### Subscription Events

- ✅ `subscription.active` - Activates subscription, updates user status
- ✅ `subscription.on_hold` - Handles failed renewal
- ✅ `subscription.renewed` - Extends subscription period
- ✅ `subscription.plan_changed` - Handles upgrades/downgrades
- ✅ `subscription.cancelled` - Cancels subscription
- ✅ `subscription.failed` - Records failed subscription creation
- ✅ `subscription.expired` - Handles expiration

#### Refund Events

- ✅ `refund.succeeded` - Records successful refunds
- ✅ `refund.failed` - Logs failed refunds

### 4. Features

- ✅ **Idempotency**: Tracks `webhook-id` to prevent duplicate processing
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Logs errors, tracks retry count
- ✅ **User Matching**: Finds users by email from webhook data
- ✅ **One-Time Access**: Grants 30 or 365 days based on product metadata
- ✅ **Subscription Management**: Creates/updates subscriptions automatically
- ✅ **Payment Tracking**: Stores all payment details including card info

## 🎯 Current Status

### Server Running

```
✅ Server running on http://localhost:3001
✅ Webhook endpoint: http://localhost:3001/api/webhook/dodo-payments
✅ Environment: development
✅ Database: Connected
```

### Environment Variables

```env
✅ DODO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY=54AOXKjz...
✅ DODO_PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_Zf+nAO73oiKb4YZRka2cxPU...
✅ DODO_PAYMENTS_ENVIRONMENT=test_mode

## 📋 Next Steps for Testing

### 1. Webhook Already Configured! ✅

**Great news**: Based on the Dodo dashboard screenshot, your webhook is already set up and working!

- **Webhook URL**: Already configured (using Svix Play for testing)
- **Events Delivered**: 3 successful events already received
  - ✅ `payment.succeeded`
  - ✅ `subscription.active`
  - ✅ `subscription.renewed`

### 2. Update to Local Development URL (Optional)

If you want to test with your local server instead of Svix Play:

```bash
# Install ngrok if not already installed
brew install ngrok  # macOS
# or download from https://ngrok.com/download

# Start ngrok tunnel
ngrok http 3001

# Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
```

Then update the webhook URL in Dodo Dashboard:

1. Go to your existing webhook in Dodo Dashboard
2. Click "Edit"
3. Update URL to: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/webhook/dodo-payments`
4. Save changes

### 3. Test Payment Flow

1. Go to `/upgrade` page on your app
2. Click "Get Started Now" on any plan
3. Complete payment on Dodo's checkout page
4. Check server logs for webhook processing
5. Verify in Prisma Studio:
   - Payment record created
   - Subscription record created (if subscription)
   - User status updated
   - WebhookEvent logged

### 4. Test with Dodo Dashboard

1. In Dodo Dashboard, go to your webhook
2. Click "Testing" tab
3. Select event type (e.g., `payment.succeeded`)
4. Click "Send Example"
5. Check server logs for processing

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Check Webhook Logs

```bash
# Start Prisma Studio
npm run prisma:studio

# View tables:
# - WebhookEvent (all webhooks received)
# - Payment (all payments)
# - Subscription (all subscriptions)
```

### Server Logs to Watch For

```bash
# Successful webhook processing:
📨 Received webhook from Dodo Payments
✅ Webhook signature verified
📝 Webhook event stored: [id]
🔄 Processing event: payment.succeeded
💰 Payment succeeded: pay_xxxxx
✅ Payment record updated
✅ Webhook processed successfully

# Subscription activation:
🎉 Subscription activated: sub_xxxxx
✅ Subscription activated for user: user@example.com
```

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Before Production

- [ ] Test all webhook events in test mode
- [ ] Verify payment flow end-to-end
- [ ] Test subscription renewal (may need to wait or simulate)
- [ ] Test cancellation flow
- [ ] Verify one-time purchase grants correct access
- [ ] Check error handling for edge cases

### Production Setup

- [ ] Update Dodo Dashboard webhook URL to production domain
- [ ] Ensure HTTPS is enabled on production server
- [ ] Set up monitoring/alerting for webhook failures
- [ ] Configure database backups
- [ ] Test webhook with real payment (small amount)

## 📊 Data Flow

```
User Purchase
     ↓
Dodo Checkout Page
     ↓
Payment Processed
     ↓
webhook: payment.succeeded
     ↓
Our Server
     ├─ Create Payment record
     ├─ Find user by email
     └─ Grant access (if one-time)
     ↓
webhook: subscription.active (if subscription)
     ↓
Our Server
     ├─ Create Subscription record
     ├─ Set subscription period
     └─ Update user status to "active"
     ↓
User has access ✅
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Received

- Check ngrok is running and URL is correct
- Verify webhook URL in Dodo Dashboard
- Check server is running on port 3001
- Check firewall/network settings

### Signature Verification Failed

- Verify `DODO_PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env`
- Check webhook secret matches Dodo Dashboard
- Ensure raw body parsing is working

### User Not Found

- Verify user email exists in database
- Check email in webhook payload matches user email exactly
- User must be signed up before purchasing

### Payment Not Recorded

- Check server logs for errors
- Verify database connection
- Check WebhookEvent table for processing errors
